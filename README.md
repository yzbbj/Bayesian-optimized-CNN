# Bayesian-optimized-CNN
Using Bayesian optimization to optimaze the network of CNN,which is used in fault diagnosis

Original data come from Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center.Futhure details can be seen in the repository called https://github.com/yzbbj/Data-of-Case-Western-Reserve-University and the doc file called .Acctually you should download those files first so as to create initial data of your project.

You should use 'create-set.m' first to create data sets,which are uesed to train different CNN networks.Then you should run 'Bayesian-opitimized-CNN.m' and it produces a 'XX.mat' file to save the outputs.
